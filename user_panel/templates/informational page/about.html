            <h2>Our Platform</h2>
            <p>VigiLink is a subdivision-based neighborhood safety watch system designed to strengthen community security through smart, connected technology. Developed as a web-based platform, VigiLink empowers residents, homeowner associations, and local authorities to work together in keeping their subdivision safe.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, VigiLink is focused exclusively on subdivisions such as Deca Homes and Camella Homes as part of a trial phase — a way to measure how effective the system can be on a smaller scale before upgrading it to serve entire districts. This approach allows us to fine-tune features, ensure reliability, and prove just how powerful and valuable the platform can be.</p>
            
            <p>In each subdivision, the Home Owner (subscriber) manages the community's account, overseeing only the residents who live in or have purchased property within their area. The Home Owner also encourages residents to join the system, ensuring everyone is connected to the same safety network.</p>
